 FBLA Mobile Application Development- Aira Dani, Aashna Shah. (Northview High School)

Our app enables students to schedule easier. By providing them with a calendar, email, social media access, a school lunch menu, and more, students can access all their school information in one go! 

# Installation:

Our app can be installed using any device that can MacOS. XCode is the environment of choice, since app was first built in it.

Like any other app, ours took a lot of testing and fixing issues to make it the best possible version we could. We faced issues with our calendar aspect of the app. Because a majority of our app was programmed and not storyboarded, it was harder to pinpoint the problem. After checking and rechecking every line of code, we were able to find and fix.

Features we would like to implement in the future might include an option to connect with other students at your school, this could allow students to compare schedules if they wanted to work on a school assignment later in the day. 

# Table of Contents:

On the left side of our app’s XCode set up, there’s a list of view controllers that were programmed. These are listed by the name of the job they accomplish. 

# How to use:

Simply clicking the run button, will open up a sign up/in screen which users can then choose and operate accordingly. Once logged in, there’s a welcome screen which can then be clicked to go to schedule. Once on schedule, use the + button in top right hand corner to add events. Then using the tag bar at the bottom of the screen, users can operate the app and explore the different features. A majority of the app is self explanatory with its user interface and there’s options to access social media.
